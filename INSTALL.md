  Virtual Storage Manager for Ceph
==========================================================

**Version:** 1.0

**Source:** 2015-01

**Keywords:** Ceph, Virtual Storage Management

Preparation
===================================
Before you get ready to install VSM, you should prepare your environment. The sections here are very helpful for understanding the deployment concepts.

**Note**For a Ceph cluster created and managed by VSM you need to prepare at least three storage nodes plus a VSM controller node. VSM requires a minimum of three Ceph storage nodes before it will create a Ceph cluster.

#Roles
There are two roles for the VSM cluster.
## Controller Node
The controller node is used to run mysql, rabbitmq, web ui services for the VSM cluster.
## Storage Node
The storage or agent node is used to run the vsm-agent service which manages the Ceph and physical storage resources.

#Network
There are three kinds of networks defined in VSM.
## Management Network
Management Network is used to manage the whole VSM cluster. Every node in the VSM cluster should have this.
## Ceph Public Network
Ceph Public Network is used by Ceph to manage Ceph client to server IO operations.
## Ceph Cluster Network
Ceph Cluster Network is used by Ceph to transfer data between OSDs for replication and rebalancing.

##Recommendations
Controller node should contain at least:

    - Management Network

Storage Node should contain:

    - Management Network
    - Ceph Public Network
    - Ceph Cluster Network

###Sample 1
**Controller node** contains the networks listed below:

    - 172.169.32.0/21 # accessing internet.
    - 192.168.123.0/24

**Storage node** contains networks below:

    - 192.168.123.0/24
    - 192.168.124.0/24
    - 192.168.125.0/24

Then we may assign these networks as below:

    - Management network: 192.168.123.0/24
    - Ceph public netwok: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph cluster network: 192.168.125.0/24

The configuration for VSM in the `cluster.manifest` file should be:

    [management_addr]
    192.168.123.0/24

    [ceph_public_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_cluster_addr]
    192.168.125.0/24

**Note** Here we do not use the public network for accessing the internet in our VSM cluster.

**cluster.manifest** Do not worry about this file right now. It is discussed later, in the storage node setup.

### Sample 2
But how about when all the nodes just have two NICs. Such as a controller node and storage node having:

    - 192.168.124.0/24
    - 192.168.125.0/24

We can assign these two networks as below:

    - Management network: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph public network: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph cluster network: 192.168.125.0/24

The configuration for VSM in `cluster.manifest` file should be:

    [management_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_public_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_cluster_addr]
    192.168.125.0/24

### Sammple 3
It's quite common to have just one NIC for demo environments. Thenall nodes just have:

    - 192.168.124.0/24

We may assign this network as below:

    - Management network: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph public network: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph cluster network: 192.168.124.0/24

So all of the networks just use the same network. The configurations in VSM `cluster.manifest` file would then be:

    [management_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_public_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_cluster_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

#Operating System
We have done our development and testing based on CentOS 6.5 Linux system. For successful installation of VSM, it's best to install system with **CentOS-6.5 Basic Server**.

After install of a clean CentOS 6.5 Basic Server option system, do not run:

    yum update

Otherwise you may get conflicts between yum packages when you install VSM.

#Build RPMs
After you download the source code from the VSM github, the first step is to build the VSM RPMs. If you already have VSM RPMs, you can jump to [VSM RPM Install](#RPM_Install).

## Setup Yum Repo
###Step 1
Mount CentOS-6.5-DVD1.iso as your repo.

    mount -o loop CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso /media/CentOS/

Then add a repo file `dvd.repo` in /etc/yum.repos.d/:

    [dvdrepo]
    name=CentOS-DVD
    baseurl=file:///media/CentOS/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1
    proxy=_none_

Then run:

    yum makecache

###Step 2
Add a public repo, and make sure you can access internet. Add the public repo file `public.repo`:

    [theforeman-plugin-source]
    name=theforeman-plugins
    baseurl=http://yum.theforeman.org/plugins/1.5/el6/source

**Note** There are no extra spaces at the beginning of each line in `public.repo` file. If they exist, delete these beginning extra spaces. Downloading packages from the internet sometimes may take awhile. You could for example set `keepcache=1` in /etc/yum.conf, and then you can find all of the downloaded RPM packages under the /var/cache/yum directory. Then you can use these packages to build an offline repo for VSM.

Then rum:

    yum makecache

##<a name="RPM_Install"></a> VSM RPM Build
After you setup the repo, and make sure it works, you can build the RPMs from source code.

    cd $source_code_path
    ./buildrpm

After building, all the rpms are located in $source_code_path/vsmrepo directory.

## VSM RPM Install

Go to the directory that you placed your VSM RPMs in, or the /vsmrepo directory if you just built them from source.

You can use `yum localinstall` to install vsm packages by:

    cd vsmrepo

    yum localinstall python-vsmclient-2014.11-0.8.0.el6.noarch.rpm \
    		vsm-dashboard-2014.11-0.8.0.el6.noarch.rpm \
   		 vsm-2014.11-0.8.0.el6.noarch.rpm \
    		vsm-deploy-2014.11-0.8.0.el6.x86_64.rpm

**Note**: vsm-dashboard will use the httpd service to setup the Web UI. Sometimes it conflicts with the OpenStack dashboard, so try to install the OpenStack dashboard and the VSM dashboard onto different nodes.


# Installation

Here is the information about the sample installation environment and its roles:

* 1. test1-controll: 192.168.123.4
* 2. test1-storage1: 192.168.123.40, 192.168.124.54, 192.168.125.117
* 3. test1-storage2: 192.168.123.179, 192.168.124.122, 192.168.125.109
* 4. test1-storage3: 192.168.123.193, 192.168.124.59, 192.168.125.77

So we configure the network as below in VSM:

    - Management network: 192.168.123.0/24
    - Ceph public network: 192.168.124.0/24
    - Ceph cluster network: 192.168.125.0/24

**Note**You should set network appending on your network environment or check the network settings mentioned before.

## Dependcies
For every node, regardless of if it’s a controller node or a storage node, do the steps below:

    - Firstly, assume you've built & installed the VSM RPM packages as mentioned before.
    - After that, install the required services for VSM.

        preinstall


There is an incompatibility issue with python-django-horizon module, whereby the module should be downgraded to the lower version 2013.1.1-1.

### For a brand new install:
*   Remove the installed python-django-horizon package
  *   # rpm –e python-django-horizon

*   Download these rpm packages from [vsm-dependencies github repository](https://github.com/01org/vsm-dependencies/tree/master/repo ), the packages below are required to be downloaded from this web site:
  *   Python-django-horizon, python-quantumclient, python-swiftclient, python-cinderclient, python-glanceclient, python-nova client

*   Reinstall python-django-horizon package (in this order)
  *   # rpm –ivh python-quantumclient-2.2.1-2.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm -ivh python-swiftclient-1.4.0-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-cinderclient-1.0.4-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-glanceclient-0.9.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-novaclient-2.13.0-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-django-horizon-2013.1.1-1.el6.noarch.rpm
*   Reinstall vsm-dashboard, this is exactly the same one from v0.9.1 release package
  *   # rpm –ivh vsm-dashboard-2014.12-0.9.1.el6.noarch.rpm


### For existing broken install (where you previously installed and ran vsm-controller and it failed)
*   Remove installed vsm-dashboard and python-django-horizon packages
  *   # rpm –e vsm-dashboard
  *   # rpm –e python-django-horizon

*   Download these rpm packages from [vsm-dependencies github repository](https://github.com/01org/vsm-dependencies/tree/master/repo ), below packages are required to be downloaded from this web site:
  *   Python-django-horizon, python-quantumclient, python-swiftclient, python-cinderclient, python-glanceclient, python-nova client

*   Reinstall python-django-horizon package (in this order)
  *   # rpm –ivh python-quantumclient-2.2.1-2.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm -ivh python-swiftclient-1.4.0-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-cinderclient-1.0.4-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-glanceclient-0.9.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-novaclient-2.13.0-1.el6.noarch.rpm
  *   # rpm –ivh python-django-horizon-2013.1.1-1.el6.noarch.rpm
*   Reinstall vsm-dashboard, this is exactly the same one from v0.8 release package
  *   # rpm –ivh vsm-dashboard-2014.11-0.8.0.el6.noarch.rpm

*   Reboot the vsm controller node


## Firewall and SELinux
### Solution 1
1>  Disable SELinux in the file /etc/selinux/config

    SELINUX=disabled

2>  Close the firewall

    service iptables stop

### Solution 2
1> If you want to open selinux, you should run commands below to add policies httpd:

    setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1 &
    chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/
    chmod -R a+r /var/www/html/

2> Settings for iptables. You should open these ports on every nodes in VSM.

    22 ssh
    80 http
    443 https for future use
    6789 Ceph Monitor
    6800:8100 Ceph
    123 ntp
    8778  vsm
    5673  rabbitmq
    35357 keystone
    5000  keysone
    3306 mariadb

Here is one sample configuration `iptables`, take it as references.

    *filter
    :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
    :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

    -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
    -A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
    COMMIT

##Hosts file

VSM will sync /etc/hosts file from the controller node. Make sure your controller node's /etc/hosts file follows these rules:

    - All the ip address should be listed in /etc/hosts file for very node.
    - Lines with `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `::1` should not contains the actual hostname.

Take the correct version as an example to set your /etc/hosts file to on the controller node.

### Correct version

    127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
    ::1             localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
    192.168.123.4 test1-control

    192.168.122.172 test1-storage1
    192.168.123.40 test1-storage1
    192.168.124.54 test1-storage1
    192.168.125.117 test1-storage1

    192.168.122.216 test1-storage2
    192.168.123.179 test1-storage2
    192.168.124.122 test1-storage2
    192.168.125.109 test1-storage2

    192.168.122.167 test1-storage3
    192.168.123.193 test1-storage3
    192.168.124.59 test1-storage3
    192.168.125.77 test1-storage3

**Note**Although 192.168.122.0/24 network is not used by VSM, you should include it in the /etc/hosts file.

### Wrong version

    127.0.0.1       test1-control localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
    ::1             test1-control localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
    192.168.123.4 test1-control

    192.168.123.40 test1-storage1
    192.168.124.54 test1-storage1
    192.168.125.117 test1-storage1

    192.168.123.179 test1-storage2
    192.168.124.122 test1-storage2
    192.168.125.109 test1-storage2

    192.168.122.167 test1-storage3
    192.168.123.193 test1-storage3
    192.168.124.59 test1-storage3
    192.168.125.77 test1-storage3

**Error**:

    - You cannot put `hostname` in lines with localhost.
    - Not all of the IP address are listed for test1-storage1 and test1-storage2.


## Setup controller node
====================
###Edit and check the file /etc/manifest/cluster.manifest

**modify three IP addresses**

1>  For the VSM controller, edit the file /etc/manifest/cluster.manifest and modify it as described below:

focus on the validity of the three IP addresses, and modify them according to your environment.
`management_addr` is used by VSM to communicate with different services, such as using rabbitmq to transfer messages, rpc.call/rpc.cast etc.`ceph_public_addr` is a public (front-side) network address. `ceph_cluster_addr` is a cluster (back-side) network address.

    [management_addr]
    192.168.123.0/24

    [ceph_public_addr]
    192.168.124.0/24

    [ceph_cluster_addr]
    192.168.125.0/24

2> Now check the correctness of your cluster.manifest file by running the manifest checker:

    cluster_manifest


###Install

3>  Install the vsm controller.

    vsm-controller

**Note**After executing this command, it will generate a configuration file located in /etc/vsmdeploy/deployrc owned by root. If you want to use the old version of /etc/vsmdeploy/deployrc, you may run `vsm-controller -f /etc/vsmdeploy/deployrc`.

**Warning** Do not set proxy env during installation.

## Setup storage node
### server.manifest
**step 1**
For VSM storage nodes, edit the file `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` and modify it as described below:

    [vsm_controller_ip]
    #10.239.82.168

Update `vsm_controller_ip` to the VSM controller's IP address under subnet `management_addr`

    [vsm_controller_ip]
    192.168.123.4  #refer to test1-controll node.

**step 2*

Generate the `auth_key` by running the following command on the VSM controller node:

    [root@test1-control manifest]# agent-token
    9291376733ec4662929eadcf9eda3b44-e38aeba41c884fc88321ac84028792e4

Then run the command below for every storage node:

    replace-str 9291376733ec4662929eadcf9eda3b44-e38aeba41c884fc88321ac84028792e4

**step 3**
The storage you use for your Ceph cluster must have previously been provisioned by you with a label and a partition. For example:

	parted /dev/sdb -- mklabel gpt
	parted -a optimal /dev/sdb -- mkpart xfs 1MB 100%

Enter your primary and associated journal storage information in the `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` file.

For example, change the lines below:

    [10krpm_sas]
    #format [sas_device]  [journal_device]
    %osd-by-path-1%   %journal-by-path-1%
    %osd-by-path-2%   %journal-by-path-2%
    %osd-by-path-3%   %journal-by-path-3%

to be:

    [10krpm_sas]
    #format [sas_device]  [journal_device]
    /dev/sdb /dev/sdc1
    /dev/sdd /dev/sdc2
    /dev/sde /dev/sdf

Then delete the redundant lines with %osd-by-path%, if you have fewer disks.

**step 4**
We recommend though that you use disk-by-path instead for the disk paths. Use the command below to find the true by-path:

    ls -al /dev/disk/by-path/* | grep `disk-path` | awk '{print $9,$11}'

For example:

    ls -al /dev/disk/by-path/* | grep sdb | awk '{print $9,$11}'
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0c.0-virtio-pci-virtio3 ../../sdb

Then replace the /dev/sdb with `/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0c.0-virtio-pci-virtio3` in `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` file. Do this also for all the other disks listed in this file.

**Warning** It may cause an error when you add a disk without by-path. So, If you can not find the by-path for a normal disk, you should not use it. Or if you use it to create the cluster, and the create cluster fails, please delete it from the `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` file.

After that the disk list appears like this:

    [10krpm_sas]
    #format [sas_device]  [journal_device]
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0c.0-virtio-pci-virtio3   /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0d.0-virtio-pci-virtio4
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0e.0-virtio-pci-virtio5   /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0f.0-virtio-pci-virtio6
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:10.0-virtio-pci-virtio7   /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:11.0-virtio-pci-virtio8

**step 5**
If you have several kinds of storage media, and you want these disks organized into different storage groups in VSM, then you may follow the operations below. Otherwise, you may skip this step and just put all the disks into the [10krpm_sas] section.

You may want to add disks into other sections in the `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` file after the [10krpm_sas] section. Take [ssd] as an example:

1> Add storage class in `/etc/manifest/cluster.manifest` in controller node.

    [storage_class]
    ssd # add this line
    10krpm_sas

2> Add storage group in `/etc/manifest/cluster.manifest` on the controller node.

    [storage_group]
    high_performance_test  High_Performance_SSD_test ssd

**Note** No extra spaces in word, use \_ to instead spaces.

3> Add disks under `/etc/manifest/server.manifest` on the storage node(s) which have SSD, such as:

    [ssd]
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0c.0-virtio-pci-virtio9   /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0d.0-virtio-pci-virtio1
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0e.0-virtio-pci-virtio11   /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:0f.0-virtio-pci-virtio14
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:10.0-virtio-pci-virtio23  /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:11.0-virtio-pci-virtio10

4> Now check the correctness of your server.manifest file by running the manifest checker:

   server_manifest


##Setup VSM for the storage node
After the configuration of `/etc/manifest/server.manifest`, you may run:

    vsm-node

to complete setup of the storage node.

#Login the webUI

After the command is finished executing, and to check if you have setup the controller correctly, do the following steps:

1.  Access https://vsm controller IP/dashboard/vsm.(for example https://192.168.123.4/dashboard/vsm)
2.  User name: admin
3.  Password can be obtained from: /etc/vsmdeploy/deployrc, the ADMIN_PASSWORD field

        cat /etc/vsmdeploy/deployrc |grep ADMIN_PASSWORD

4.  Then you can switch to the `Create Cluster` Panel, and push the create cluster button to create a ceph cluster. Good Luck!
